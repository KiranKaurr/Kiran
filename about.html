		Hi, Im Kiran and I go to Hurlstone Agricultural High School.

My favourite subjects have to be IST, Hsie, Photography and English, especially history. Hurlstone is an amazing school to go to and in the 3 years I've been there, I've made so many good friends and had amazing times both education wise and social wise.
