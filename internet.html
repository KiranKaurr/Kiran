	<h3> How the web works !! </h3>

	<div class=figure>

</div>
	 The application protocol that helps the web work is Hypertext Transfer Protocol (http). However this is not to be confused with Hypertext Markup Language (html). HTML is a language that is used to write web pages whereas HTTP is the protocol that web browsers and web servers use to communicate with each other over the internet. HTTP is a connectionless text based protocol meaning that web browsers send requests to web servers for web elements such as web pages and images. Once the request is serviced by a server, the connection between client and server across the internet is disconnected. 
	</p>
	 <p>
	 <h3> Web Servers !! </h3>
	 A web server will process incoming network requests over HTTP and several other related protocols. The primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver web pages to clients. The communication between client and server will take place using HTTP and pages delivered are most frequently HTML documents which can include images, style sheets and scripts in addition to text content.

	 <h3> Web Browsers !! </h3>
	  Web browsers are software applications that are used for accessing information on the WWW. When a user requests a specific website, the web browser will retrieve the necessary content from a web server and then display the web page on the user‚Äôs device. However, a web browser is not the same thing as a search engine. Google Search, Bing or DuckDuckGo are search engines aka just a website. These simply store searchable data about other websites. To connect to a website‚Äôs server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed such as Google Chrome or Safari.

<h2> WWW, the Internet and Intranet </h2>

	<h3> How is the WWW different to the Internet ?? </h3>
	WWW {World Wide Web} is a collection of information/web pages found on a network of computers. The internet is a global network of networks that the WWW must use in order to access it‚Äôs information. For example, the Internet is a big book-store whereas the Web is a collection of books in that store. 
	<h3> What is the intranet ?? </h3>
	An intranet is a private network that is contained within an enterprise and it could consist of many interlinked local area networks. It could also use leased lines in the wide area network. Typically, an intranet will include connections through one or more gateway computers to the outside internet. It‚Äôs drastically different to the internet as the internet is something anyone can access at home meaning it‚Äôs not a private network. Simply put, an intranet will go between computers in a single building or within a single organisation whereas the internet goes between ALL computers connected to it, even if it‚Äôs indirectly.

<h3> Whats an intranet protocol ?? </h3>
An internet protocol is a set of rules for routing or addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Packet switching is a way for data to travel across the internet and IP information is attached to each packet which helps routers to send packets to the right place. HTTP is a protocol that is used to transmit all data present on the WWW which includes text, multimedia and graphics. It‚Äôs the protocol that is used to transmit HTML- a coding language- and it works upon TCP/IP. TCP/IP is a stream protocol which means that there is a negotiated connection between a client and a server. Any data that is transmitted between these two endpoints is guaranteed to arrive therefore making it a‚Äùlossless‚Äù protocol. FTP is another protocol which is used to transmit files between computers connected to each other by a TCP/IP network aka the internet.
