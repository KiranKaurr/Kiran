	<h2> What is this website?? 🧐 </h2>
	<p>
		This website is an easy way for students to have their assignments all in one place. It removes any unnecessary clutter and makes it easier for both the student and teachers. 
	</p>
	<p>
		 It becomes easier to drop future assignments in and showcase past assignments to teachers, friends or family :) 
		</p>
		<p>
			You can also keep track of past assignments and it acts as backup in case any hard copy copies go missing 😁
